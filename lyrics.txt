Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah)
Everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions
Other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak
For itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these
Rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he sent me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot, " I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that
I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is
The greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission
Cementin' the spot as the greatest who did it
Before it all ends, nigga
