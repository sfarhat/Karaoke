A web app that, given a song name and its artist, will display the full karaoke experience to sing along too. Complete with the song, lyrics, and a synchronized lyric guide.

Design
----

Karaoke has 3 main components:

1. Music to hear
2. Lyrics to read
3. A lyric guide in time with the audio

While the first 2 items can be straightforwardly scraped from the Internet with no prep necessary, the lyric guide (also known as the **Forced Alignment**) requires more heavy lifting. Specifically, it requires the audio and lyrics beforehand, and for a performance increase, the audio should be source separated to just be the vocals.

This directly motivates our design.

### Backend Design (Flask/Python)

- To get the lyrics, I used the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries to scrape Google Search results, since they conveniently serve the raw lyrics.
- To get the song audio, I used the [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) library to scrape Youtube for the video containing the song's audio, and extracted it via `ffmpeg`.
- For improved alignment, I passed the song into a source separator. I chose to use [`Spleeter by Deezer`](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) since they provided an easy to use Python API.
- To get the alignment, I passed in the lyrics and separated vocals into a forced aligner. I chose to use the [`Gentle Aligner`](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle) in the form of a Docker container which functions as a REST API. Unfortunately, the official container on Docker Hub is not actively maintained, so I'm using this updated one instead [`cnbeining/gentle`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbeining/gentle)

### Frontend Design

1. An HTML form will receive the desired song and artist name
2. Javascript uses the Fetch API to query the Flask backend for the data/behavior it wants in the following order

    1. Lyrics via the URL `/lyrics?song-name={song name}+artist-name={artist name}`. It receives an `OK` response if the backend successfully saves the lyrics to a local `.txt` file
    2. Audio via `/audio?song-name={song name}+artist-name={artist name}`. It receives an `OK` response if the backend successfully saves the song to a local `.mp3` file
    3. Source separation via `/source-separator`. It receives an `OK` response if the backend successfuly separates the song audio and saves a local `vocals.wav` file
    4. Alignment via `/alignment`. If successful, it receives a `JSON` with the word-to-timestamps for each word in the lyrics
    
3. Display the fetched lyrics
4. Create a player for the fetched song
5. Feed the alignment `JSON` into an animation pipeline that will highlight the appropriate word(s) in time with the song playing

This entire process takes between 1-2 minutes. The very first run will take a bit longer because it needs to download the pretrained models necessary for the aligner to work.

Deployment
----

To keep up to date with modern app/service development practices, I decided to container-ize this with Docker. The details of the built image can be found in [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/sfarhat/Karaoke/blob/main/Dockerfile). By itself, the container will do everything except forced alignment of lyrics, which is done by another Docker container. So to make the overall architecture work, we need to Compose these 2 Docker images into one project. The implementation of this can be found in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/sfarhat/Karaoke/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

### CI Pipeline
- Every push to the `main` branch triggers an image build on DockerHub

Installation
----

1. Download Docker
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd` into the directory where `docker-compose.yml` is
4. Run the following code in your terminal

        docker compose up
        
3. The app is now running on [`localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000)

### TODO

Stylize the page for better UI/UX

Create a better Forced Aligner
